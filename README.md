# Hangman Game

A classic word guessing game implemented in Python. Try to guess the secret word letter by letter before the hangman drawing is complete!

## How to Play

### Game Rules
1. **Objective**: Guess the secret word by suggesting letters one at a time
2. **Correct Guesses**: When you guess a letter that's in the word, it gets revealed in all positions where it appears
3. **Wrong Guesses**: When you guess a letter that's not in the word, a part of the hangman gets drawn
4. **Winning**: Reveal all letters in the word before the hangman drawing is complete
5. **Losing**: If you make 6 wrong guesses, the hangman is complete and you lose
